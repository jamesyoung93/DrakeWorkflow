# DrakeWorkflow
An example of making a workflow in  R with Drake. Download and unzip the folder, open the r project environment and open DrakePlan.r. Executing the lines in DrakePlan.r 
sequentially (after installing necessary packages) should recreate the workflow and result in the intermediate csv files and the final AllData.csv.
